This project consists of five parts. 
1. In class presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1maS8itjtwLz1LGLoe_IzaGOvr054AqAjauwhz4m-Z-4/edit?usp=sharing
2. Paper results reproduction:
   
    TO RUN MIP-NERF:
      - Open the google folder located here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O-enyC4T3pAI3exF1yl2eRZnq9GG34p0?usp=sharing
      - Open MipNeRF_GestureControl.ipynb
      - Follow instructions to train, visualize, and render mesh from the trained model

3. Algorithmic extension
   
   To run Tiny NeRF Gesture Control:
      - Open the google folder located here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O-enyC4T3pAI3exF1yl2eRZnq9GG34p0?usp=sharing
      - Open TinyNeRF_GestureControl.ipynb
      - Follow instructions on the notebook to run
  
   To run Mip-NeRF Gesture Control:
      - Open the google folder located here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O-enyC4T3pAI3exF1yl2eRZnq9GG34p0?usp=sharing
      - Open MipNeRF_GestureControl.ipynb
      - Follow instructions on the notebook to run (as long as you have a trained model already, you can skip the "Mip-NeRF Implementation" section
  
   To run Pre-rendered Gesture Control:
      - Ensure the directory of Output_Images is saved locally (roughly 183 Mb)
      - Set Output_Images file path in track_hand_preload.py
      - Run track_hand_preload.py (you'll need a webcam)
