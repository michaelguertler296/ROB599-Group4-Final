# PyTorch mip-NeRF 

A reimplementation of Mip-NeRF in PyTorch. This implementation was developed by Benjamin Beal. Most of the files in this directory were created by that project's authors and are here as a result of cloning that directory. The files we modified in this directory are:

gesture_control.py
track_hand.py
